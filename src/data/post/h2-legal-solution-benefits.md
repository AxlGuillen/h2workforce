## What is the H-2 Program?

The H-2 Visa Program is a legal pathway that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign nationals for **temporary or seasonal jobs** in industries such as:

- Agriculture (H-2A)
- Non-agricultural services (H-2B)

For Mexican workers, it represents a unique opportunity to access **formal employment** in the U.S. with **competitive wages** and **labor protections**.

## How does the process work?

1. **The employer** begins by filing a request with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) for a **Temporary Labor Certification**, proving that:
   - There are not enough available U.S. workers for the job
   - Hiring foreign workers will not negatively affect local wages or conditions
2. The employer then submits **Form I‑129** to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
3. **The Mexican worker** must:
   - Have a valid passport
   - Schedule a visa interview at the U.S. Consulate or Embassy in Mexico
   - Submit required documentation
   - Pass a consular interview and background check

> ✅ Once approved, the worker may enter the U.S. to work with the sponsoring employer for a period typically ranging from **3 to 10 months**, with the possibility of extension.

## Key Benefits for Employers and Workers

- 💵 **Competitive wages**: between $18 and $20 USD per hour, in accordance with the *Fair Labor Standards Act* and DOL-approved contracts.
- 🏠 **Housing and transportation**: provided by the employer, following labor regulations.
- 🛡️ **Labor protections**:
  - Safe working conditions
  - Regulated work hours
  - Overtime pay
- 🧾 **Access to U.S. Social Security** from the first day of the contract
- 🔁 **Eligibility for rehire** in future seasons
