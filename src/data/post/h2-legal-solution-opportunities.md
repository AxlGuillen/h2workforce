## What is the H-2 Visa Program?

The H-2 Visa Program in the United States is a legal mechanism that allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers for **temporary or seasonal jobs** in key industries such as:

- Agriculture (H-2A)
- Non-agricultural services (H-2B)

For Mexican workers, this program offers access to **formal, well-paid employment** with **labor protections** in the U.S.

## How Does the Process Work?

The process begins when the U.S. employer submits a request to the **U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)** to obtain a **Temporary Labor Certification**, proving that:

- There are not enough U.S. workers to fill the positions
- Hiring foreign workers will not adversely impact the working conditions of local employees

Next, the employer files **Form I-129** with **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**.

The Mexican worker must:

- Hold a valid passport
- Schedule an appointment at the U.S. Consulate or Embassy in Mexico
- Submit personal documents
- Pass the visa interview and background check

Once the visa is approved, the worker can travel to the U.S. to work for the sponsoring employer during the authorized period‚Äî**typically between 3 and 10 months**, with the possibility of renewal.

## Key Benefits

- üíµ **Competitive and formal wages**, ranging from **$18 to $20 USD per hour**, according to the *Fair Labor Standards Act* and DOL-approved contracts
- üßæ **Social Security benefits** starting from day one of the contract
- üè† **Employer-provided housing and transportation**, compliant with DOL requirements
- üõ°Ô∏è **Guaranteed labor protections**, including:
  - Safe working conditions
  - Regulated work hours
  - Overtime pay
- üîÅ **Opportunity for rehire** in future seasons
- üìà **Builds a positive work history**, which may ease the path toward a more stable immigration status
