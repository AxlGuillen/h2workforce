## The Mexican workforce: the driving force of U.S. agriculture

The agricultural sector in the United States, especially in **California, Texas, and Florida**, is experiencing a growing shortage of seasonal labor. According to USDA data, there are an estimated **2.4 million agricultural job vacancies** in 2024, with **56% remaining unfilled** due to a lack of personnel.

In April 2025, workers hired through the H-2A program earned an average of **$19.52 USD per hour**, marking a **3% increase from the previous year**. This reflects both high demand and rising labor costs.

## Context and challenges of the H‚Äë2A program

Since 2005, the number of authorized H-2A positions has increased from **48,000 to 378,000** in 2023 ‚Äî a clear indicator of growing dependence on the program to support U.S. agriculture.

However, **agricultural production is at risk** due to restrictive immigration policies. Recent reports show that ICE raids have caused **absenteeism even among legal workers**, disrupting dairy and field operations and leading to major local economic losses. Farmers in states like New York have described the situation as **‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù** if restrictions tighten further.

In response, the Department of Labor (DOL) **suspended the implementation of 2024 regulations** that would have further complicated the program. In addition, the DOL and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a temporary increase of **64,716 H-2B visas** for 2025, prioritizing experienced workers from previous seasons.

## Why Mexican labor matters

- üõ†Ô∏è Legal certainty and reduced supply chain disruptions
- ‚è≥ Fewer delays and lower costs related to labor shortages
- üíµ Higher wages reflecting fairer working conditions
- üîÑ Seasonal rehires of experienced workers
- ü§ù Stability and long-term sustainability in agribusiness

## Practical tips for U.S. agricultural employers

### 1. Plan ahead

Start your H‚Äë2A hiring process **8 to 10 months in advance** to meet DOL requirements and avoid delays during planting and harvest seasons.

### 2. Prioritize legal hiring

Avoid fines and ICE raids. Using the H‚Äë2A program ensures **legal compliance, workforce stability**, and protection from federal audits.

### 3. Rehire experienced talent

Many Mexican workers return each season with experience in specific crops. **Rehiring them reduces training time and boosts productivity.**

### 4. Work with authorized agencies

Partnering with organizations like **H2 Work Force** provides end-to-end support for visa processing, labor certification, and logistics. This **minimizes legal risks and administrative burden.**

### 5. Invest in fair labor conditions

Providing **decent housing, local transportation, and safe working environments** is not only required by H‚Äë2A, but also improves **worker retention and employer reputation.**

### 6. Diversify your legal labor sources

If H‚Äë2A demand exceeds quotas, consider **H‚Äë2B workers** for non-agricultural tasks or explore **DHS pilot programs** for additional support.
